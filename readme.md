Reproducible Research for Association Rules


- main idea (a few paragraphs)

From this project,we could see that Association Rules are an extremely interesting method of data analysis which can relatively easily find out about many interesting relationships. And also, I did Reproducible Research by using same methods for another datasets, which prove the reproducibility of my code.

- description of the dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/gorkhachatryan01/purchase-behaviour

This dataset gives us information about the things people purchase when they go to a shop. The raws are the people who buy specific things when they go to a shop. 
By looking at the patterns what they buy, 
we can get an understanding to reorder the things in the shop in a better way to help people feel more convenient in finding what they want in an easier way!

Then we do reproducibility of my methods on different datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/market-basket-optimization/version/1

- app/analysis/report structure

Load the data
do some Analysis
Get visualization and plots
Find the relationship between different object by using Association rules
Do reproducibility
Conclusion

- research methods (if applicable)

some methods from UnsupervisedLearning:  like association rules or clustering
