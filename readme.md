Reproducible Research for Association Rules


- main idea (a few paragraphs)

This paper deals with the analysis called association rules.
A common example is customer purchase analysis, which is an attempt to guess whether the consumer will buy the product/products Y if he buys product/products X. product/products X.

The Previous research data is taken from kaggle platform.  https://www.kaggle.com/gorkhachatryan01/purchase-behaviour

The original paper is from my ML project, I would like to improve it by Reproducible Research.

Do reproducibility of association rules on different datasets:

- app/analysis/report structure

Load the data
do some Analysis
Get visualization and plots
Find the relationship between different object by using Association rules
Do reproducibility
Conclusion

- research methods (if applicable)

some methods from UnsupervisedLearning:  like association rules or clustering
